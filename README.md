# VBS ChatGPT Integration

## Overview

This project fulfills a childhood dream of integrating a modern AI model, OpenAI's ChatGPT, with an old-school scripting language: Visual Basic Script (VBS). The goal is to enable communication with the powerful ChatGPT API using the VBS language, which is primarily used for Windows scripting and automation.

As a child, I was simulating conversations using techniques like Markov chains, but the technology was limited. Today, with the advent of sophisticated AI models like GPT, my childhood dream of having a sofisticated AI in a vbs file is realized with this project.

## Features
- **Simple VBS file**: Leverages basic Windows scripting to connect to the OpenAI API.
- **Direct communication with ChatGPT**: Send prompts and receive responses, making use of the cutting-edge GPT model for natural language interaction.
- **Easy to set up and use**: This project requires only minor configuration to connect to the API, making it accessible to anyone with a Windows environment.
- **Nostalgic feel with modern technology**: Relive the days of simple scripting languages while utilizing the power of AI.
